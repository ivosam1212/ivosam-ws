Another example of live documentation is the [**React Native SDK**](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/get-started-react-native-SDK) documentation. This Help Center section for Adjust is an example of my contribution to developer documentation.

It is important to mention that even though this whole section is of my authorship, I followed the company template and their **DevDocs** style guide, making some content similar across the other SDKs that the company provides. For example, description of concepts, method overviews, and some setup instructions. The challenge here was to understand how the React Native SDK works and which code snippets are relevant to its different classes and methods, as well as to propose ways to improve the current SDK documentation.

The SDK includes these articles and their sub-pages:

- [React Native SDK](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/get-started-react-native-SDK)
    - [Features](https://help.adjust.com/en/developer/features-react-native-sdk)
    - [SDK reference](https://help.adjust.com/en/developer/react-native-sdk-reference)
