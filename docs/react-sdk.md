Another example of live documentation is the [**React Native SDK**](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/get-started-react-native-SDK) section. This Help Center section for Adjust is an example of developer documentation.

It is important to mention that even though this whole section is of my authorship, I followed the company template and their **DevDocs** style guide, making it very similar in concept description as all the other documents for the SDKs that the company provides. The challenge here was to understand how the React Native SDK works and fetching the code snippets relevant to its different classes and methods.

The SDK includes these articles and their sub-pages:

- [React Native SDK](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/get-started-react-native-SDK)
    - [Features](https://help.adjust.com/en/developer/features-react-native-sdk)
    - [SDK reference](https://help.adjust.com/en/developer/react-native-sdk-reference)
